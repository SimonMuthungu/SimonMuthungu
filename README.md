  Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a memes app with django web framework
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and database on w3 schools and freecodecamp
- I am also working with datasets on kaggle and learning to draw insights from data
- I'm also building a web scrapper program from scratch that can fill a csv file with scrapped data from the internet
- I have built a rock paper scissors game and a hangman game in python just for practise: the former I built on my own from scratch while the latter was inspired.
- I have a HTML CSS certificate from freecodecamp - it helps me with building my memes app
