  Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  My name is SIMON MUTHUNGU and this is my repo. Im a proud owner of every project in this repo unless ive stated otherwise. These are but some of my achievements.
  
- I have created a web scrapper program that scrapes Jumia website in the mobile phones category and writes that info into a csv file. I figured that was better than having to waste time perusing phone by phone. Now, I know which phone to buy! :)


- I just finished writing a money payment program in python that has full functionality like the Mpesa system. Its in my github.
- I just earned a python developer certification from freecodecamp. 
- I have built a rock paper scissors game in python.
